I am a data guy currently working as an Analytics Engineer. I have extensive experience in building and automating data products, specialising in stakeholder‑focused solutions and cloud‑based data transformations. Proven track record in high‑growth and startup environments. I recently migrated our customer‑facing BI tool, from Looker to Omni; all the while maintaining operational continuity along with implementing infrastructure changes that delivered significant cost savings. I delivered impactful analytics solutions including automated model validation systems, revenue forecasting models representing £2bn in annual revenue, and real‑time dashboards to monitor algorithm performance, SLA compliance, and forecast accuracy. Strong emphasis on stakeholder engagement and technical leadership in cross‑functional teams. 

Looking for interesting projects and data sets to play around with! Any completed analysis and/or models, I will link to this site.
