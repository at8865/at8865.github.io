## * Practical Machine Learning Project:
https://at8865.github.io/Practical-Machine-Learning-Prediction-Assignment-Writeup/
The goal of this project was to predict the manner in which participants lifted barbells, from data that was taken from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. Two models were analysed: Decision Tree and Random Forest. It was shown that the Random Forest model had the highest accuracy of the two models, and by extension, the lowest out of sample error.
