This project presents a comprehensive analysis of database performance issues and strategic solutions to improve query execution times for data consumers across an orga nisation.

## Project Overview

**Challenge**: Data consumers company-wide were experiencing significantly slow query response times, impacting productivity and user experience.

**Objective**: Investigate the root causes of performance degradation and propose actionable solutions to improve end-user experience while considering cost implications.

**Approach**: Systematic analysis of Snowflake query history data to identify bottlenecks and optimisation opportunities.

## Case Study Brief

The investigation focused on analysing two key datasets containing:
- Query execution logs with performance metrics
- Database object access patterns
- Warehouse utilisation statistics

### Key Data Points Analysed

**Query Performance Metrics:**
- `TOTAL_TIME` - Complete query execution duration
- `EXECUTION_TIME` - Actual processing time
- `QUEUEING_TIME` - Time spent waiting in warehouse queue
- `BYTES_SPILLED_TO_REMOTE` - Memory overflow indicators

**Infrastructure Context:**
- `WAREHOUSE_SIZE` - Compute resource allocation
- `WAREHOUSE_NAME` - Resource distribution patterns
- `QUERY_TYPE` - SQL operation categorisation
- `HUMAN_USER` - User vs. automated query distinction

**Data Access Patterns:**
- `DATABASE_ID` and `SCHEMA_NAME` - Resource hotspots
- `SCHEMA_INDEX` - Multi-schema query complexity

## Methodology

The analysis employed a structured approach to problem decomposition:

1. **Performance Baseline Establishment** - Quantified current query performance across different dimensions
2. **Bottleneck Identification** - Isolated primary causes of slowdowns using statistical analysis
3. **Resource Utilisation Assessment** - Evaluated warehouse sizing and queue management
4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis** - Balanced performance improvements against operational costs
5. **Solution Prioritisation** - Ranked recommendations by impact and implementation complexity

## Key Findings & Recommendations

The investigation revealed several critical performance bottlenecks and proposed targeted solutions addressing:

- Warehouse sizing optimisation strategies
- Query queue management improvements
- Resource allocation rebalancing
- Schema access pattern optimisation
- Memory management enhancements

*Detailed analysis, findings, and implementation roadmap are available in the complete presentation below.*

## Project Deliverable

## Technical Considerations

**Data Processing**: Given the large dataset size, the analysis utilized tools capable of handling substantial data volumes efficiently.

**Audience**: Recommendations were tailored for the data guild audience, comprising engineers and analysts responsible for implementation, with focus on:
- User experience impact
- Cost optimisation
- Implementation feasibility
- Measurable performance improvements

## Implementation Impact

The proposed solutions provide a framework for:
- Reducing average query response times
- Optimising warehouse resource utilisation
- Improving overall data platform reliability
- Establishing performance monitoring best practices
